# RFP_proj
a project to identify the RFPs

rfp_functions.py is the function module that includes useful tools to identify the reversed flux patches.

RFP_examples jupyter notebook shows how to use these functions.

Please run calculate_Br first to creat the Br datafile which will be read by the jupyter notebook code. However, this script is just an example and not necessary- anyone can creat the Br data in the way they like.
